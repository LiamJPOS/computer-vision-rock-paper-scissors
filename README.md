# computer-vision-rock-paper-scissors
Rock-Paper-Scissors is a game in which each player simultaneously shows one of three hand signals representing rock, paper, or scissors. Rock beats scissors. Scissors beats paper. Paper beats rock.  The player who shows the first option that beats the other player's option wins.  This is an implementation of an interactive Rock-Paper-Scissors game.

The purpose of this project is for partial fulfillment of AiCore's Career Accelerator Programme, demonstrating further proficiency in Python, and in working with Keras models.
